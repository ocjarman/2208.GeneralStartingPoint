- path to get there:
  - dont need to use create-react-app, this is a starting point with necessary files
  - cors: a library that handles cost/origin/resource/something - when you make a req to a website that isnt yours, allows axios to do stuff it wouldnt be (but we wont make use of it)
- create db folder with db.js & index.js
  - in db file, connect to db
  - create db in psql with command 'createdb movie_db'
  - in index.js, pull in db
  - create tables/models in db folder
